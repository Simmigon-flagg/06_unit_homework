Run a capture on your homework network on any device. Leave the capture running in the background for 2+ hours. Be sure to use the device some while it is running!

Stop the capture.


Identify at least 2 instances of suspicious, interesting, and/or unfamiliar protocols/communication.


To complete this challenge, you'll submit a document named Home-Analysis in your Challenge-2 folder. It should include:


A 2-3 paragraph write-up for each of the communication examples (4-6 paragraphs total).


Images and screenshots to communicate how you found the communication, and how you investigated it.

An explanation of any unfamiliar protocols and how they work, if relevant.


A description of the purpose and outcome of that communication.
